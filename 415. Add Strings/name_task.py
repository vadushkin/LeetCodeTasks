"""Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger).
You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

Constraints:

1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104
num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
num1 and num2 don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
