"""We want to split a group of n people (labeled from 1 to n) into two groups of any size.
Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.

Given the integer n and the array dislikes where dislikes[i] = [ai, bi] indicates
that the person labeled ai does not like the person labeled bi,
return true if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 2000
0 <= dislikes.length <= 104
dislikes[i].length == 2
1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= n
ai < bi
All the pairs of dislikes are unique.
