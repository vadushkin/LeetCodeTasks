"""Given a string s representing a valid expression,
implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which
evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
s represents a valid expression.
'+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
'-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
