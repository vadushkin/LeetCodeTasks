"""Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted
in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which
the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
