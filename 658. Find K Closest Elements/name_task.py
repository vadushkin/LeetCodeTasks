"""Given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x,
return the k closest integers to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.

An integer a is closer to x than an integer b if:

|a - x| < |b - x|, or
|a - x| == |b - x| and a < b

Constraints:

1 <= k <= arr.length
1 <= arr.length <= 104
arr is sorted in ascending order.
-104 <= arr[i], x <= 104
