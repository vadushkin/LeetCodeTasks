"""Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding
(i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).

A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's,
the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.
This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

     Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence
                       |              (binary)
   --------------------+-----------------------------------------
            1          |   0xxxxxxx
            2          |   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
            3          |   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.

Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data.
This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

Constraints:

1 <= data.length <= 2 * 104
0 <= data[i] <= 255
