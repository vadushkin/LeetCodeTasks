"""Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
