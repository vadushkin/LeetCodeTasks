"""You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node,
and return the head of the modified linked list.

The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node
from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.

For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
1 <= Node.val <= 105
