"""You have n dice and each die has k faces numbered from 1 to k.

Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible
ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice so the sum of the
face-up numbers equals target. Since the answer may be too large,
return it modulo 109 + 7.

Constraints:

1 <= n, k <= 30
1 <= target <= 1000
