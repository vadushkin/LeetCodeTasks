"""Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2.
answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.
Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000
