"""We have two special characters:

The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.

Constraints:

1 <= bits.length <= 1000
bits[i] is either 0 or 1.
