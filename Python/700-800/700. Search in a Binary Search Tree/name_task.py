"""
You are given the root of a binary search tree
Find the node in the BST that the node's value
equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node.

* Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]

* Example 2:
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []

Constraints:

* [1, 5000]
* 1 <= Node.val <= 107
* root
* 1 <= val <= 107
