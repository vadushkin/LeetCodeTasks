"""Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1,
find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can
visit from node i (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).

Constraints:

n == graph.length
2 <= n <= 15
0 <= graph[i][j] < n
graph[i][j] != i (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
All the elements of graph[i] are unique.
The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.
