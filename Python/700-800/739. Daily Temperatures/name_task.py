"""Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures,
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have
to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature.
If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Constraints:

1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100
