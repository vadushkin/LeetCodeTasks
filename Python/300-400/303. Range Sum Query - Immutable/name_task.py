"""Given an integer array nums, handle multiple queries of the following type:

Calculate the sum of the elements of nums between indices left
and right inclusive where left <= right.
Implement the NumArray class:

NumArray(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
int sumRange(int left, int right)
Returns the sum of the elements of nums between indices
left and right inclusive (i.e. nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]).

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
0 <= left <= right < nums.length
At most 104 calls will be made to sumRange.
