"""
You are given the root of a binary tree containing
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases
are generated so that the answer will fit in a

* Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

* Example 2:
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

Constraints:

* 1 -> 2 -> 3
* [1, 1000]
* 0 <= Node.val <= 9
* 10
