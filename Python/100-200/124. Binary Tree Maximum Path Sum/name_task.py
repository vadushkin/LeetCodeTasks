"""A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent
nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them.
A node can only appear in the sequence at most once.
Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
