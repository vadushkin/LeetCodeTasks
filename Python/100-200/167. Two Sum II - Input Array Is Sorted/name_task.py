"""
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2,
added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

Constraints:

2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-1000 <= target <= 1000
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
