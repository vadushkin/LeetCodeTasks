"""Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
