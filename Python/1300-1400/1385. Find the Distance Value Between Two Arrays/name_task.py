"""
Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, and the integer d,
return the distance value between the two arrays.

The distance value is defined as the number of elements arr1[i]
such that there is not any element arr2[j] where |arr1[i]-arr2[j]| <= d.

Constraints:

1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 500
-1000 <= arr1[i], arr2[j] <= 1000
0 <= d <= 100
