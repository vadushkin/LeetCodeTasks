"""Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100
s and goal consist of lowercase English letters.
