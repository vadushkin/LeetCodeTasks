"""Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 20
1 <= p.length <= 30
s contains only lowercase English letters.
p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.
