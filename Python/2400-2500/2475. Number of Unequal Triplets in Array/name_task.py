"""
You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums.
Find the number of triplets (i, j, k) that meet the following conditions:

0 <= i < j < k < nums.length
nums[i], nums[j], and nums[k] are pairwise distinct.
In other words, nums[i] != nums[j], nums[i] != nums[k], and nums[j] != nums[k].
Return the number of triplets that meet the conditions.

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
