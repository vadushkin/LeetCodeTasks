"""A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of 0's (possibly none),
followed by some number of 1's (also possibly none).

You are given a binary string s. You can flip s[i] changing it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of flips to make s monotone increasing.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
