"""On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points.
Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or
the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi]
represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest
possible number of stones that can be removed.
