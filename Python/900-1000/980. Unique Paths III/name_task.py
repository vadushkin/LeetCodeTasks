"""You are given an m x n integer array grid where grid[i][j] could be:

1 representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
2 representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
0 representing empty squares we can walk over.
-1 representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.
Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square,
that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 20
1 <= m * n <= 20
-1 <= grid[i][j] <= 2
There is exactly one starting cell and one ending cell.
