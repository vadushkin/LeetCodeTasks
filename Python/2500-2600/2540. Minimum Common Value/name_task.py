"""
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order,
return the minimum integer common to both arrays.
If there is no common integer amongst nums1 and nums2, return -1.

Note that an integer is said to be common to nums1 and nums2
if both arrays have at least one occurrence of that integer.

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 105
1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109
Both nums1 and nums2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
