"""Given an integer array nums and an integer k,
return true if nums has a continuous subarray of size
at least two whose elements sum up to a multiple of k, or false otherwise.

An integer x is a multiple of k if there exists an integer n such that x = n * k. 0 is always a multiple of k.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= nums[i] <= 109
0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 231 - 1
1 <= k <= 231 - 1
