Given an integer array nums and an integer k, modify the array in the following way:

choose an index i and replace nums[i] with -nums[i].
You should apply this process exactly k times. You may choose the same index i multiple times.

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= k <= 104
