"""For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t
(i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

Constraints:

1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000
str1 and str2 consist of English uppercase letters.
