"""Given the root of a complete binary tree,
return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last,
is completely filled in a complete binary tree,
and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104
The tree is guaranteed to be complete."""
