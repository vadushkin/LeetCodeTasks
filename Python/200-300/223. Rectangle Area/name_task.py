"""Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane,
return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).

The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).

Constraints:

-104 <= ax1 <= ax2 <= 104
-104 <= ay1 <= ay2 <= 104
-104 <= bx1 <= bx2 <= 104
-104 <= by1 <= by2 <= 104
