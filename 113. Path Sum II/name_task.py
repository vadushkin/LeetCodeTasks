"""Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum,
return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum.
Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000
