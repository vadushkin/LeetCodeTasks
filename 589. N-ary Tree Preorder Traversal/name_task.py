"""Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal.
Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
0 <= Node.val <= 104
The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
